# Art Hockey

This is the source code for my game [Art Hockey](https://pandaqi.com/art-hockey).

It was made in Corona Engine, now Solar2D. It was also my first game using that system, so it's not great and doesn't use it to its full potential.

The working title was "Fling Hockey", so you might encounter that within the project.

As usual, you'll need to supply your own APP id + AD ids for the mobile builds. (And you might need to upgrade / change some elements to match the latest version of Solar2D, with the name change and everything.)
